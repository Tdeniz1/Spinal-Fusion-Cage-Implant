# **Spinal Fusion Cage Implant – Project Notes**

A brief paragraph introducing the L1–L2 interbody fusion cage, key features (**posterior fixation**, **rectangular lattice**, **anti-migration teeth**, **rounded edges**, **radiolucent markers**), and the purpose of the design. Mention **FDA Class II** status and the potential **Class III** upgrade with osteoinductive gel.

## **Design Overview**

### **Key Dimensions & Geometry**
- **Length:** *value here*  
- **Width:** *value here*  
- **Height (Posterior/Anterior):** *value here*  
- **Wedge Angle:** *value here*  
- **Wall Thickness:** *value here*  
- Rectangular lattice structure for strength and osseointegration.  
- Anti-migration teeth on both top and bottom surfaces (~0.5 mm).  
- Rounded corners for reduced insertion trauma.  

### **Radiolucent Marker Placement**
- Strategic positions for optimal X-ray and fluoroscopy visibility.

---

## **Material Selection**
- **Ti-6Al-4V ELI (ASTM F136)** for biocompatibility, strength, corrosion resistance.  
- **Properties:** Young’s Modulus, Yield Strength, and why this alloy is standard in spinal implants.

---

## **Regulatory Classification**

  ### **Current Classification**
- **FDA Class II Medical Device** under *21 CFR §888.3080* – Intervertebral body fusion device.
- Covered by FDA Special Controls: **ASTM F2077**, **ASTM F2267**, and **ISO 10993** biocompatibility standards.

### **Upgrade to Class III**
- Adding **osteinductive gel** would reclassify this as a **combination product** (device + biologic) under *21 CFR §3.2(e)*.
- Which would require **Premarket Approval (PMA)** as per *21 CFR Part 814*.

## **Theoretical Osteoinductive Gel Design**

This section outlines the conceptual design for an **osteinductive gel** intended to enhance fusion rates and bone ingrowth when used with the L1–L2 interbody cage.  
- **Composition:** Biodegradable hydrogel base infused with BMP-2 analogs, calcium phosphate nanoparticles, and controlled-release growth factors.  
- **Function:** Promotes osteoblast recruitment, angiogenesis, and mineralized matrix deposition within the lattice pores.  
- **Integration:** Gel is injected into the oversized lattice cavities pre-surgery or during implantation.  
- **Regulatory Impact:** Addition of this biologic material changes classification to **FDA Class III**

## **Pore Size Considerations**

### **Current State**
- Oversized pores in present design for speed of prototyping and visual demonstration.

### **Rationale**
- Easier modeling and printing at concept stage.  
- Allows discussion of alternative filling methods.

### **Solutions**
- Adjust to **300–700 µm** range for final implant.  
- Fill with gel or scaffold during surgery.  
- Treat each large hole as representing multiple smaller pores for simulation purposes.

## **Finite Element Analysis (FEA)**

### **Setup**
- Autodesk Fusion 360 static stress simulation.  
- **Load:** 1500 N axial compression, inferior surface fixed.  
- **Material:** Ti-6Al-4V ELI.  
- Coarse mesh due to software constraints; refinement planned.

### **Results**
- **Max von Mises stress:** ~14 MPa (*well below 880 MPa yield*).  
- **Max displacement:** ~0.001 mm.  
- **Factor of Safety:** >60.

## **Standards & Testing Requirements**
- **ASTM F2077** – Mechanical testing (compression, shear, torsion).  
- **ASTM F2267** – Subsidence resistance.  
- **ISO 10993** – Biocompatibility.  
- **FDA Special Controls** for spinal systems.  
- Material compliance: **ASTM F136**.

---

## **Manufacturing Notes**
- Designed for additive manufacturing (**EBM/SLM**).  
- Post-processing: HIP, surface blasting, anodizing.  
- Scalability for patient-specific variants.

---

## **Future Development**
- Refined pore sizes for optimal biological response.  
- Marker material optimization.  
- Custom anatomical matching.  
- In-vitro and cadaveric testing.
