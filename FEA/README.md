# FEA Results

This folder contains finite element analysis (FEA) results for the L1–L2 interbody cage.  
Simulation performed in Autodesk Fusion 360 (static stress, Ti-6Al-4V ELI, 1500 N axial load, inferior surface fixed).  
Images include von Mises stress distribution, displacement map, and safety factor visualization.  

**Note:** These are preliminary results using a coarse mesh. A refined mesh study will be conducted in the future for more accurate validation.
